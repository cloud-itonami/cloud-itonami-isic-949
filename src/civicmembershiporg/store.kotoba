  "SSoT for the ISIC-949 civic membership organization administrative coordination actor.

  This actor coordinates the back-office operations of civic membership organizations
  (community groups, civic associations, and other membership-based organizations):
  member enrollment logistics, event/meeting scheduling, dues-processing logistics,
  and facility management. It never touches membership-eligibility decisions,
  religious-doctrine content, political-position content, advocacy-policy content,
  or dues-amount/fee-waiver decisions -- see `civicmembershiporg.governor`'s
  `scope-exclusion-violations`, a HARD, permanent, un-overridable block.

  `MemStore` -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for dev/tests/demo (no deps).
  A `members` directory keyed by `:member-id` STRING, an `events` directory keyed by
  `:event-id` STRING, and an `accounts` directory for dues-tracking.

  A registered/verified member record must exist before ANY proposal for that member
  may ever commit or escalate."
